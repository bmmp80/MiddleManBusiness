### This will include it by deafult later on so it doesn't have to be built by users

## 1. Install Python if you don't have it already installed (ideally the latest version).

## 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the root of this project folder in command prompt.
Run this command:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## 3. Install PyInstaller
Run this command:
  pip install pyinstaller

## 4. Build the Executable
